Principles of Redux
	1) Whether app is simple or complex, app will be represented as a single JavaScript Object.
		All mutations and changes to to the state are explicit.
	
	
The redux store:
	1) It holds the current application state object
	2) It lets you dispatch actions
	3) Need to specify the reducer
	
Reducer - tells how the state is updated with actions

The store has 3 important methods
	1) getState() - retrieves the current state of the redux store
		Ex. store.getState();
	2) dispatch - allows you to dispatch actions to change the state of your application
		Ex. store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
	3) subscribe - let's you register a callback that the store will call anytime an action has been dispatched.
